# tech-blog-db

## Description

This project is a tech blog website so that tech-enthusiasts may post and comment with others over their shared interest in tech.  Alternatively, you can SOURCE the schema in db, then in the terminal "npm start" and you'll be able to access the website. The motivation behind this project was to practice using servers and databases that can exist permanently and not just locally -- on top of the MVC paradigm.  

## Installation

SOURCE the db schema. Start the server with npm start, then access the page on localhost 3001.
